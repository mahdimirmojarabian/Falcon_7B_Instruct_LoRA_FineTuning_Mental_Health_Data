# üöÄ Falcon-7B-Instruct LoRA Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning **Falcon-7B-Instruct (sharded version)** with **LoRA** on a **mental health conversational dataset**. The entire process is executed on **Google Colab**, leveraging **T4 GPUs** for cost-effective model training.

---

## üìå **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates fine-tuning of the Falcon-7B-Instruct model using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** to improve conversational responses in mental health dialogue. The model is trained on a specialized dataset, with metrics tracked on **Weights & Biases**, and model artifacts pushed to **Hugging Face Hub**.

## üöÄ **Get Started**
Follow the Colab Jupyter Notebook for the full process:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mahdimirmojarabian/Falcon_7B_Instruct_LoRA_FineTuning_Mental_Health_Data/blob/main/Falcon_7B_Instruct_LoRA_FineTuning_Mental_Health_Data.ipynb)

> **Important**: Change the **Runtime to T4 GPU** in Colab for optimal performance.

## üîó **Hugging Face Integration**
To enable pushing the model to your Hugging Face account:  
1. Create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join).  
2. Navigate to **Access and Tokens** in your profile settings.  
3. Create a **New Token** with:
    - Name: `<Your Token Name>`
    - Role: **write**  

Add this token during model push to Hugging Face Hub.

## üìä **Weights & Biases Tracking**
To monitor training metrics and visualize performance:  
1. Create an account on [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site).  
2. Create a new project for your experiment.  
3. Under the **Projects** tab, retrieve your **API key**.  

Integrate this key during the model training step.

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion**
We successfully fine-tuned the **Falcon-7B-Instruct (sharded version)** model using **LoRA** and **QLoRA** configurations. The fine-tuned model demonstrated enhanced conversational capabilities, especially in mental health dialogues. The entire process was executed on **Google Colab**, making it accessible for those without high-compute environments.  
This workflow can be adapted for different business needs by simply curating datasets and leveraging the same tuning pipeline, enabling powerful, task-specific model optimizations.

## üí° **Next Steps**
- Integrate with real-time chat applications.
- Deploy the fine-tuned model on Hugging Face Spaces.
- Experiment with larger datasets for enhanced contextual understanding.
